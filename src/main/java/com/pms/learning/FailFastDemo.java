üîê Thread Safety Approaches
Synchronized Collections: Achieve thread safety using synchronized wrappers (e.g., Collections.synchronizedList()).

Concurrent Collections: Use advanced mechanisms like segmentation (ConcurrentHashMap) or copy-on-write (CopyOnWriteArrayList).

‚öôÔ∏è Performance and Scalability
Synchronized Collections:

Use object-level locking ‚Äî entire collection is locked during operations.
Iterators are not thread-safe; must use manual synchronization.
Poor scalability with increasing size or iteration time.

Concurrent Collections:

Use fine-grained locking (e.g., segment-level in ConcurrentHashMap).
Allow concurrent reads and controlled writes (CopyOnWriteArrayList).
Better performance and scalability under high concurrency.

üõ†Ô∏è Use Case Suitability
Synchronized Collections:

Simpler, familiar to developers using synchronized blocks.
Easily retrofit thread safety into existing code.
Suitable for low-concurrency scenarios.

Concurrent Collections:

Designed for high-concurrency applications.
Best when collections need to scale and handle many threads.
Ideal when reads dominate writes (especially CopyOnWriteArrayList).

‚öñÔ∏è Trade-offs
Copy-on-write collections are inefficient for frequent writes due to high cost of copying.
No one-size-fits-all ‚Äî the choice depends on concurrency level, modification frequency, and compatibility needs.

‚úÖ Conclusion
Understand the trade-offs and choose:

Synchronized for simplicity and legacy compatibility.

Concurrent for better performance and scalability in multi-threaded environments.
